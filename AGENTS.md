# Agents

This is an Obsidian vault with AI agent skills. See [USER.md](USER.md) for the vault owner's identity. Agents working in this repo should be aware of the following structure and conventions.

## Skills

Custom skills live in `.agents/skills/`. Each has a `SKILL.md` with usage, workflow, and conventions.

| Skill                                                          | What it does                                               | Arguments                                                   |

## Rules

Shared rules live in `.agents/rules/` and are the single source of truth. Agent-specific wrappers point to them.

| Rule | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [qmd-search](.agents/rules/qmd-search.md) | Prefer QMD over grep for vault search (always apply) |
| [skill-conventions](.agents/rules/skill-conventions.md) | Skill structure, shared conventions, project context |
| [skill-registry](.agents/rules/skill-registry.md) | Keep skill tables in sync when skills change |

### Agent wrappers

| Agent | Instruction files | How rules are loaded |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | Auto-injected by glob; each `.mdc` points to `.agents/rules/` |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/skills/CLAUDE.md` | Read on startup; point to `.agents/rules/` |
| OpenCode / Crush | `OpenCode.md` | Read on startup; points to `.agents/rules/` |

## Vault Layout

```
Meetings/              Meeting notes by subfolder (PAM/, TBs/, Eng/, etc.)
Templates/             Obsidian templates
Teams/People/          Person files: @Name.md
Teams/                 Team files: +TeamName.md
ToDo's.md              Aggregated Tasks plugin view
Tracker.md             Project tracker
```

## Conventions

- **User**: See [USER.md](USER.md) for identity, timezone, aliases, and agent behavior rules.
- **Frontmatter**: YAML between `---` fences. `modified:` is managed by Obsidian — never set manually.
- **Participants**: `[[@Name]]` wikilinks (people) or `[[+Team]]` (teams).
- **AI Transcripts**: Cached under `## 🤖 AI Notes` with provider subheadings and collapsible callouts (`[!gemini_notes]-`, `[!gemini_todos]-`, `[!gemini_transcript]-`).
- **Tasks priorities**: 🔺 highest, ⏫ high, 🔼 medium, 🔽 low.

## MCP Servers

Configured in [.cursor/mcp.json](.cursor/mcp.json). Provides Google Workspace tools (Docs, Drive, Calendar).

## Syncing from Upstream

If you forked or cloned this repo into a private vault, you can pull structural updates (skills, rules, shared conventions) without overwriting your personal data.

```bash
./.scripts/sync-upstream.sh              # fetch + merge
./.scripts/sync-upstream.sh --preview    # see what's new without merging
```

First-time setup:

```bash
git remote add upstream <url-to-this-repo>
./.scripts/sync-upstream.sh              # auto-configures merge driver on first run
```

Protected paths (always keep local version during merge): `USER.md`, `Tracker.md`, `.env`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, `Meetings/`, `Teams/`, `Templates/`, `Recaps/`. Edit `.gitattributes` to add or remove paths.
