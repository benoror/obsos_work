# Meeting

## Usage

- `/meeting {title}` — Create a meeting note with the given title and today's date.
- `/meeting {title} folder={subfolder}` — Create in a specific subfolder under `Meetings/`.
- `/meeting` (no args) — List today's Google Calendar events and let the user pick one. *(Requires Google Calendar MCP — see Setup below.)*
- `/meeting wrap <path>` — Wrap up an existing meeting by running `/cache-notes`, `/fill-participants`, and `/followup-todos` in sequence, with a single commit at the end.
- `/meeting wrap pending [<dates>]` — Find meetings missing any wrap step and wrap them in sequence. Optional date filter (see Mode D).

## File Naming

Format: `{Title} - YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Examples:
- `PAM - Weekly check-in - 2026-02-18.md`
- `Ben x Zak Sync - 2026-02-23.md`
- `Alert System Brainstorm and Requirement Gathering - 2026-02-06.md`

Exception — Scrum dailies in `Meetings/PAM/Scrum/` use just `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

## Frontmatter

Every meeting note starts with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
Notes:
created: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS-06:00
---
```

- `Notes:` is left empty (populated later with Google Docs / Otter links).
- `created:` uses the current local timestamp in ISO 8601 with timezone offset.
- `Participants:` is intentionally omitted at creation time (filled later by `/fill-participants`).
- `modified:` is managed by Obsidian automatically — do NOT set it.

## Mode A: Manual Creation

**Input**: `/meeting {title}` with optional `folder={subfolder}`

### Workflow

1. **Parse arguments**: Extract the title and optional folder.
2. **Determine folder**: If `folder=` is provided, use `Meetings/{subfolder}/`. Otherwise, ask the user which subfolder to use. List existing subfolders for convenience.
3. **Generate filename**: `{Title} - YYYY-MM-DD.md` using today's date.
4. **Check for duplicates**: If a file with the same name already exists, warn the user and ask how to proceed.
5. **Create the file** with frontmatter. If a matching template exists in `Templates/`, ask the user if they want to apply it as the note body.
6. **Confirm** by printing the created file path.

### Subfolder Shorthand

Accept common abbreviations when provided inline:

| Shorthand | Resolves to |
|-----------|------------|
| `pam` | `PAM` |
| `scrum` | `PAM/Scrum` |
| `1on1`, `1:1` | `One-on-ones` |
| `eng` | `Eng` |
| `qa` | `QA` |
| `tb`, `tbs` | `TBs` |
| `hire`, `hiring` | `HiRing` |
| `onboard` | `Onboarding` |
| `pe` | `PE Leadership` |

Case-insensitive matching. If no shorthand matches and the folder doesn't exist, ask before creating it.

## Mode B: Google Calendar Selection

> **Requires**: Google Calendar MCP server. See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for installation.

**Input**: `/meeting` (no arguments)

### Workflow

1. **Fetch today's events** from Google Calendar using the MCP tool.
2. **Present a numbered list** of today's meetings (title, time, attendees).
3. **User picks one** (or types a number).
4. **Derive the title** from the calendar event name.
5. **Infer the subfolder** from attendees or event title:
   - If all attendees are from one team, suggest that team's folder.
   - If it's a 1:1 (2 attendees), suggest `One-on-ones/` or `TBs/`.
   - Otherwise, ask the user.
6. **Create the file** following the same steps as Mode A (steps 3-6).
7. **Pre-fill Participants** from calendar attendees. See [people-resolver](../_shared/people-resolver.md) for name matching rules. Flag any unmatched attendees.

## Mode C: Wrap Up (`/meeting wrap`)

**Input**: `/meeting wrap <path>` — path to an existing meeting note (e.g. `Meetings/PAM/Ben x Zak Sync - 2026-02-25.md`)

If `<path>` is omitted, list today's meeting files under `Meetings/` and let the user pick one.

### Workflow

This is a **sequenced workflow** — sub-skills skip their individual commit steps.

1. **`/cache-notes <path>`** — If `Notes:` frontmatter is empty, prompt the user to paste external resource URLs first. Then fetch and cache AI transcripts.
2. **`/fill-participants <path>`** — Resolve and fill the `Participants:` frontmatter if missing. If already filled, skip silently.
3. **`/followup-todos <path>`** — Extract action items and propose todos from the now-cached content and manual notes.
4. **Commit** — See [/commit](../commit/SKILL.md). Stage all files modified across the three sub-skills. Commit message: `update: /meeting wrap <path>`.

Between each sub-skill, re-read the file to pick up changes from the previous step.

## Mode D: Wrap Pending (`/meeting wrap pending`)

**Input**: `/meeting wrap pending [<dates>]`

Finds all meetings under `Meetings/` that haven't been fully wrapped and runs the wrap sequence (Mode C) on each.

### Pending Detection

A meeting is **pending** when it is missing any of these frontmatter properties:

| Property | Set by |
|----------|--------|
| `Notes:` with URLs (not empty/absent) | User or `/cache-notes` prompt |
| `NotesCached:` | `/cache-notes` |
| `Participants:` | `/fill-participants` |
| `TodosExtracted:` | `/followup-todos` |

For each pending file, show which steps are missing so the user knows what to expect.

### Date Filtering

See [date-filter](../_shared/date-filter.md) for the full syntax and date parsing rules.

When `<dates>` is provided, only consider meetings whose date matches. Default (omitted): all pending meetings.

### Workflow

See [vault-context](../_shared/vault-context.md) for vault discovery conventions.

1. **Discover** meeting files using QMD: `qmd-search` for files under `Meetings/` (any naming format). For date-filtered runs, search by date strings (`YYYY-MM-DD`) in the range. For unfiltered runs, use `qmd-multi_get` with glob `Meetings/**/*.md` to get all files.
2. **Read frontmatter** of each discovered file. Check for the four properties above.
3. **Filter by date** if `<dates>` was provided. Extract the date from the filename (`YYYY-MM-DD` pattern — files use varying formats, don't assume a specific naming convention).
4. **Present the pending list** to the user as a table:

```
| # | File | Missing | Date |
|---|------|---------|------|
| 1 | Meetings/PAM/Some Meeting - 2026-02-20.md | Notes URLs, Cache, Todos | 2026-02-20 |
| 2 | Meetings/Eng/Sync - 2026-02-22.md | Participants, Todos | 2026-02-22 |
| 3 | Meetings/PAM/Scrum/2026-02-25.md | Cache, Todos | 2026-02-25 |
```

5. **Ask the user** which meetings to wrap (e.g. "all", "1,3", "none").
6. **For each selected meeting**, run the Mode C wrap sequence (`/cache-notes` → `/fill-participants` → `/followup-todos`). Pause between meetings for user input (URLs, todo confirmation, etc.).
7. **Commit once** at the end — stage all files modified across all wrapped meetings. Commit message: `update: /meeting wrap pending — N meetings`.

### Batch Behavior

- Process meetings **oldest first** (by date from filename).
- Between each meeting, print a separator with the current file and progress (e.g. `[2/5] Wrapping: Meetings/PAM/...`).
- If a meeting fails mid-wrap (e.g. Google Docs API error), report the error, skip it, and continue with the next.

## Offer to Commit

See [/commit](../commit/SKILL.md). Applies to Mode A and Mode B only — Modes C and D handle their own commits at the end of the sequence.

## Important Notes

- Always use the Write tool to create new files — never shell commands.
- Use today's date from the system (do not hardcode).
- The timezone offset is `-06:00` (CST). Adjust if the user specifies otherwise.
- If the user provides a full date in the title (e.g., "Sync 2026-03-01"), use that date instead of today's.
