# Agents

This is an Obsidian vault managed by Your Name. AI agents working in this repo should be aware of the following structure and conventions.

## Skills

Custom skills live in `.agents/skills/`. Each has a `SKILL.md` with usage, workflow, and conventions.

## Rules

Cursor rules in `.cursor/rules/` are auto-injected based on glob patterns.

| Rule                                                     | Applies to                  | Purpose                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [skill-conventions](.cursor/rules/skill-conventions.mdc) | `.agents/skills/**`         | Enforces skill structure, commit step, Obsidian Tasks priorities, and project context    |
| [skill-registry](.cursor/rules/skill-registry.mdc)       | `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Keeps skill tables in `skill-conventions.mdc` and `AGENTS.md` in sync when skills change |

## Vault Layout

```
Meetings/              Meeting notes by subfolder (PAM/, TBs/, Eng/, etc.)
Templates/             Obsidian templates
Teams/People/          Person files: @Name.md
Teams/                 Team files: +TeamName.md

## Conventions

- **Frontmatter**: YAML between `---` fences. `modified:` is managed by Obsidian — never set manually.
- **Participants**: `[[@Name]]` wikilinks (people) or `[[+Team]]` (teams).
- **AI Transcripts**: Cached under `## 🤖 AI Notes` with provider subheadings and collapsible callouts (`[!gemini_notes]-`, `[!gemini_todos]-`, `[!gemini_transcript]-`).
- **Tasks priorities**: 🔺 highest, ⏫ high, 🔼 medium, 🔽 low.
- **Timezone**: `-06:00` (CST).
- **User**: Your Name / "Ben".

## MCP Servers

Configured in [.cursor/mcp.json](.cursor/mcp.json). Provides Google Workspace tools (Docs, Drive, Calendar).
