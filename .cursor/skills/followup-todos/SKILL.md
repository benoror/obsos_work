name: followup-todos
description: Extracts actionable follow-up items from a meeting's cached AI transcript and proposes them as Obsidian todo checkboxes. Filters by relevance, assigns owners, and suggests priorities. Use when the user says /followup-todos or asks to extract action items or todos from a meeting.

# Follow-up Todos

## Usage

- `/followup-todos <path>` — Extract and propose todos from a specific meeting note.
- `/followup-todos` (no args) — Let the user pick a recent meeting.

## Prerequisites

The meeting file should ideally have cached AI transcripts (from `/cache-notes`). If not cached, suggest running `/cache-notes <path>` first. However, the skill also works on notes with only manual content.

## Obsidian Tasks Format

Todos use the Obsidian Tasks plugin syntax:

```markdown
- [ ] Description 📅 YYYY-MM-DD 🔼
```

| Element | Format | Required |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Checkbox | `- [*]` — `[ ]` open, `[x]` done, `[/]` in progress, `[-]` cancelled | Yes |
| Assignee | `[[@Name]]` prefix | If not the user |
| Description | Free text | Yes |
| Due date | `📅 YYYY-MM-DD` | Optional |
| Priority | `🔺` (highest), `⏫` (high), `🔼` (medium), `🔽` (low) | Optional |
| Completion | `- [x]` with `✅ YYYY-MM-DD` | When done |

Nested sub-tasks use tab indentation:

```markdown
- [ ] Main task 🔼
	- [ ] Sub-task 1
	- [ ] Sub-task 2
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read the meeting note

Read the entire file. Extract action items from **all** content sources, skipping only existing `- [ ]` / `- [x]` todo lines:

1. **Manual notes** (between frontmatter `---` and `## AI Transcripts`): The user may have jotted down action items, commitments, or follow-ups during the meeting as free text (e.g. "- Talk to Chris about X", "Need to review Y"). These are first-class sources. Skip lines that are already checkboxes (`- [*]` — any single character between brackets).
2. **`[!gemini_todos]` callout**: Gemini's "Suggested Next Steps" — explicit action items.
3. **`[!gemini_notes]` callout**: Summary & Details — scan for implicit commitments ("will do X", "agreed to Y", "plans to Z").
4. **Other provider callouts** (`[!otter_todos]`, etc.): Same treatment as Gemini.

Also extract:
- Existing todos matching `- [*]` pattern (any checkbox state) to avoid duplicates
- `Participants:` from frontmatter (to resolve assignees)
- Meeting date (from filename or `created:` frontmatter)

### Step 2: Classify each action item

For each candidate action item (from manual notes, transcript todos, or implicit commitments in details), determine:

1. **Owner**: Who is responsible? Map names to `[[@Name]]` wikilinks using `Teams/People/` files.
   - If the owner is the user (Your Name / "Ben"), omit the assignee prefix.
   - If the owner is "someone in [location]" (Gemini anonymization), try to resolve from context or Participants.
   - If the owner is someone else, prefix with `[[@Name]]`.

2. **Relevance**: Score as `high`, `medium`, or `skip`:
   - **High**: Action is for the user, has a clear deliverable, or is time-sensitive.
   - **Medium**: Action is for someone else but the user should track it, or it's vague but potentially important.
   - **Skip**: Purely informational, already completed (based on date vs today), or not actionable.

3. **Priority**: Based on urgency and impact:
   - `🔺` — Blocking others, deadline this week, or critical path.
   - `⏫` — Important but not urgent, next sprint.
   - `🔼` — Moderate urgency, nice-to-have.
   - `🔽` — Low urgency.

4. **Due date**: Infer from context if mentioned ("by Friday", "next week", "end of sprint"). Otherwise omit.

### Step 3: Present proposals to the user

Display a numbered table:

```
| # | Add? | Todo | Owner | Priority | Due |
|---|------|------|-------|----------|-----|
| 1 | ✅   | Talk with Chris about temp environments | Me | 🔼 | — |
| 2 | ✅   | Offload data lake work to Rob | Me | ⏫ | — |
| 3 | ⬜   | Confirm travel plans for Friday | @Zak | — | — |
| 4 | ⬜   | Verify Vtor's prod hash deployed | Me | 🔼 | 2026-02-24 |
```

- Default `✅` for high-relevance items owned by the user.
- Default `⬜` for others' items or skippable ones.
- Let the user toggle by saying numbers (e.g. "1,3,4" or "all" or "none except 2").

### Step 4: Insert confirmed todos

Insert the confirmed todos into the note body:
- **Placement**: After any existing user content but before `## AI Transcripts`. If no user content exists, insert right after the frontmatter closing `---`.
- Use `StrReplace` targeting `## AI Transcripts` as the anchor.
- Group by owner if multiple people are involved.

### Step 5: Offer to mark as processed

After inserting, optionally add a `TodosExtracted: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS-06:00` frontmatter property to prevent re-processing.

### Step 6: Offer to commit

See [/commit](../commit/SKILL.md). Skip when called as part of a sequence (e.g. `/meeting wrap`).

## Important Notes

- Always read the file before editing — frontmatter may have changed via iCloud sync.
- The user is Your Name. References to "Your Name", "Ben", or "someone in [Your City/Country]" are the user.
- Do NOT duplicate todos that already exist in the note body (compare by description similarity).
- When in doubt about relevance, include it as `⬜` and let the user decide.
- If the meeting is old (>2 weeks), flag items that may already be completed and suggest skipping them.
