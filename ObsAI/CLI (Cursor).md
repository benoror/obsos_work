# ToDo's

- [ ] /fill-participants infer
	- There are several notes with names/firstnames/nicknames, sometimes preceded by an @ symbol, that are not directly linked to the appropriate @People. Can you search and propose replace to enhance context linking?
- [x] `/meeting` ✅ 2026-02-25
	- Can you create a skill for yourself called `/meeting` that can A) Create a new meeting file with with a "{title} - YYYY-MM-DD" format B) Optionally select a specific meeting from today's Google Calendar and create the appropriate note (we'll need to add & setup a Google Calendar integration for this)
- [x] /fill-participants ✅ 2026-02-25
	- Can you create a skill for yourself called `/fill-participants` which can A) accept `all` argument to scan all meetings with *explicit* missing participants and fill them out with confirmations & conventions workflow (what we just did), and B) accept an optional argument for an specific existing meeting note

- [ ] Otter.ai
	- On your Otter.ai question: There's no official MCP server or API client for Otter.ai. Your options would be:
  1. Bulk export from Otter.ai — Go to otter.ai > Settings > Export, download all transcripts as .txt files, and
     drop them into your vault (e.g., a Transcripts/ folder). Then I could read them directly.
  2. Browser automation — A custom script using Playwright/Puppeteer to log in and scrape transcript content, but
     that's fragile.
  3. Otter.ai API (if available on your plan) — Otter has a limited API for Enterprise plans that could be wrapped
     in an MCP server, but it's not publicly documented for personal/team plans.

  The most practical path is option 1 — export and save locally.
